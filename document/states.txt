Every Component can keep there own data base 

states is acting like ram

When we do a action the variables in state are going to get changed depending on response from DB

As the states changes the view automatically changes using Component Did mount

For updating the states we have to call the method this.setStates method with a object in it

this.setStates automatically calls the render function to load the new data
